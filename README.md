# Learn_CODE with your peers!
This is a repository which contains all the topics that I @rosekamallove studied while learning coding and am currently learning Data Structures and Algorithms, and all the code I wrote are in this repo and I am thinking of making this repo more like a Learning resourse. 
So why not contribute to it ?

By looking at people's code of the same question you are doing will help grow everyone.|




## Setting up C++ Coding Environment on Windows:
 ### It is a bit complicated for windows I will highly recommend you watch a video rather than an article

[Video Setup Hindi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0yn7irrHzM8&t=12s)

[Video Setup English ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIw02CaEusY)

[VS-Code Article](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/config-mingw)

## Setting up C++ Coding Environment on Linux:

### It is very easy on linux... just copy paste in the following commands in the terminal.

#### `sudo apt update`
#### `sudo apt install build-essential`

### And that's it.


## Compiling C++ code on the terminal :
 ( I would suggest you going through one of the following tutorial for learning the command line before compiling c++ using the terminal)

Old:

[Windows CMD Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6gx4Cwl9DGDV6SnbINlVUd0o2xT4JbMu)

Recommended for Windows:

[Windows PowerShell Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHrGresKu2w)

For Linux users: 

[Linux CLI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBokz0LTizk)

### Now for compiling the C++ code follow along:

Step 1 -> Check if g++ is installed on your computer or not by typing ``` g++ --version ``` on your terminal window.

Step 2 -> Go to the folder containing the c++ files ``` cd Learn_Code```

Step 3 -> Compile using ``` g++ file.cpp ``` this will make a executabel file named ```a.out``` which can be executed by ``` ./a.out ```

Alternatively:

Step 4 -> Compile using ``` g++ file.cpp -o file ``` this will make an executable file named ``` file ``` which can be executed by ``` ./file ```.

Note: You can choose the name of the output executable file it does not have to be same as the C++ file.





### So what is Open-Source?

Open source is a term that originally referred to open source software (OSS). Open source software is code that is designed to be publicly accessible—anyone can see, modify, and distribute the code as they see fit.

Open source software is developed in a decentralized and collaborative way, relying on peer review and community production. Open source software is often cheaper, more flexible, and has more longevity than its proprietary peers because it is developed by communities rather than a single author or company.

Open source has become a movement and a way of working that reaches beyond software production. The open source movement uses the values and decentralized production model of open source software to find new ways to solve problems in their communities and industries.

### Now what the hell is Git&&Github?
What’s a version control system?
A version control system, or VCS, tracks the history of changes as people and teams collaborate on projects together. As the project evolves, teams can run tests, fix bugs, and contribute new code with the confidence that any version can be recovered at any time. Developers can review project history to find out:

-- Which changes were made?

-- Who made the changes?

-- When were the changes made?

-- Why were changes needed?

#### I Wil Highly recommend you go through the following artile at least once.

## Setting up Git and Github on Linux:

(The following commands are for Ubuntu and other Debian based distros like Pop-os etc, you can google things for your specific distro. ) 

### Installing Git:

#### `sudo apt-get install git`

### Setting up Git:

#### `git config --global user.name "username"`
#### `git config --global user.email "useremail@example.com"`

# Why you should you contribute to open source as a student?



## 1. Unbounded learning
When working in an active open source project, students are not constrained to the boundaries of a classroom. Students can and do learn technologies and skills that go far beyond course outcomes as they're learning within a professional community. In addition, much of the learning comes from the community itself, rather than the instructor. As one student put it: "Rather than coming off like a lecture of different tools and skills, it felt more like a more experienced co-worker giving advice and tools-of-the-trade to a newcomer."

## 2. Professional interactions
As students interact with an open source community, they gain professional skills including communication, teamwork, and problem solving. In addition, open source interactions provide students with an opportunity to network with professionals while building a public portfolio of their work. As one student said about their experience in learning in open source, "...it forced me to work on a more professional level all around." Another student commented, "I found if you check your ego at the door, and do your best to provide useful, beneficial contributions the community will appreciate your work and push you in the correct direction."

## 3. Outside opportunities
Involvement in open source communities opens the door for students to grow outside of the classroom. Events like the GNOME Summit and developer meetings allow students to explore computing in new environments. For example, I had an open source community fly a student across the United States so that he could use his code to register participants at a conference where he worked one-on-one with developers from IBM, Microsoft, and Google.

## 4. Better understanding of computing
I took a group of seniors to the GNOME Summit where they presented their work to a room full of professional developers. In the car on the way home I heard, "I thought I knew what computer science was but I didn't have a clue." As one student put it, "...it allowed me to get a glimpse of what the world of computer science truly looks like to an extent that no standard classroom could give me."

## 5. Fun!
Students get excited about working on a real project where their work is publicly visible. Many instructors struggle with how to motivate students to learn. Participation in an open source project provides students with motivation that is tied to the content being learned. As one student said about their open source participation, "This experience has been invaluable and will change how I continue to learn as a software engineer throughout my career."
