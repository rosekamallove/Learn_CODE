# Learn_CODE with your peers!
This is a repository which contains all the topics that I @rosekamallove studied while learning coding and am currently learning Data Structures and Algorithms, and all the code I wrote are in this repo and I am thinking of making this repo more like a Learning resourse. 
So why not contribute to it ?

- ### What are the features of this repository?

    - Links to all of Computer Science from top Universities like MIT, Stanford, Duke, etc
    - Guiding articles, RoadMaps and Checklists
 
    - Question Bank: The problem statement and template and the  GFG link already written you just have to write the code. 
    

    - You can make a branch and start solving questions and make your own solution bank in that way we will multiple people solving the same problem with different approach, win win.

    - A great resource for our juniors or who are at a lower skill level.

    - One Stop for programming books:
        
        - Data Strucutres and Algorithms
        - Programming Languages
        - Databases
        - Linux and Windows Command Line
        - Web Development
        - App Development
        - Competitive Coding

    - Getting in a habbit of Open-Source Contribution.
    - Getting in a habbit of looking at other people's code.

# Details about the Folders in the Repository :

|S.No  |  Folder/File Name    |   About the contents   |
|----- |------           | ------                 |
|1.    | [Basics](https://github.com/rosekamallove/Learn_CODE/tree/master/Basics)    | This folder contains all the basics of C++ that one has to learn before moving on to DSA (STL (``` Vectors ``` ``` Sets ``` and ``` Maps ```) is an exception it can also be learned later or I should say it should be learnd after learnign some basic DataStructures)   .     |
|2.    | [DataStructures&Algorithm](https://github.com/rosekamallove/Learn_CODE/tree/master/DataStructures&Algorithms)    | This folder contains as the name suggests DataStructures and Algorithms written in C++, after you have learned the basics of a programming language move on with this.  |
|3.    | [Articles To Read](https://github.com/rosekamallove/Learn_CODE/tree/master/Articles%20to%20Read)    | This folder contains all the roadmaps, guides, checklists.|
|4.    | [Programming Books](https://github.com/rosekamallove/Learn_CODE/tree/master/Programming%20Books)    | This folder contains a lot of programming related books, (Reading them is not recommended only use them for reference purposes.    |
|5.    | [Questions](https://github.com/rosekamallove/Learn_CODE/tree/master/Questions)  | This folder contains Data Structures and Algorithm questions.  The problem statement and template and the GFG links are already written you just have to write the code.|
|6.    | [theNewBoston](https://github.com/rosekamallove/Learn_CODE/tree/master/theNewBoston)   | This folder contains the code for [The New Boston C++ Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAE85DE8440AA6B83)|
|7.    | templateBasic.cpp    | This is just a basic C++ template which ``` #include ``` the ```<bits/stdc++.h>``` header file which conatains almost all the header files so you can be free of the hassle of including every header file you need.|
|8.    | templateCP.cpp   |This is the compeptetve coding template most of the coders out there use. It has a lot of macros to make you fast during the contests (if you are a beginner then please do yourself a favor and ignore this) |
|9.    | [Users](https://github.com/rosekamallove/Learn_CODE/tree/master/Users)    | This is the folder you are supposed to be coding in, make a direcotry of your name copy the questions foflder in it and start solving and then create a pull request, I will merge it and what this will help in is everyone has their way of solving problem and wiriting the code for it. By looking at people's code of the same question you are doing will help grow everyone.|
